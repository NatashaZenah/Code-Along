# Places I’ve Visited

#### By Natasha Okoth

## Description

This application allows a user to keep track of places they have visited.  
Each place is created as an object with properties such as location, landmarks, time of year, and notes.

The project was built to practice using JavaScript constructors, prototypes, and basic test-driven development for business logic. A simple user interface allows users to add places and view their details.
